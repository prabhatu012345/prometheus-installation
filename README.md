What is Prometheus ?
Prometheus is a open source Linux Server Monitoring tool mainly used for metrics monitoring, event monitoring, alert management, etc.
Prometheus has changed the way of monitoring systems and that is why it has become the Top-Level project of Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
Prometheus uses a powerful query language i.e. “PromQL”.
In Prometheus tabs are on and handles hundreds of services and microservices.
Prometheus use multiple modes used for graphing and dashboarding support.
Prometheus Components
1. Prometheus Server
Prometheus server is a first component of Prometheus architecture.
Prometheus server is a core of Prometheus architecture which is divided into several parts like Storage, PromQL, HTTP server, etc.
In Prometheus server data is scraped from the target nodes and then stored int the database.
1.a. Storage

Storage in Prometheus server has a local on disk storge.
Prometheus has many interfaces that allow integrating with remote storage systems.
1.b. PromQL

Prometheus uses its own query language i.e. PromQL which is very powerful querying language.
PromQL allows the user to select and aggregate the data.
2. Service Discovery
Next and very important component of Prometheus Server is the Service Discovery.
With the help of Service discovery the services are identified which are need to scraped.
To Pull metrics, identification of services and finding the targets are compulsory needed.
Through Service discovery we monitor the entities and can also locate its targets.
3. Scrape Target
Once the services are identified and the targets are ready then we can pull metrics from it and can scrape the target.
We can export the data of end point using node exporters.
Once the metrics or other data is pulled, Prometheus stores it in a local storage.
4. Alert Manager
Alert Manager handles the alerts which may occurs during the session.
Alert manager handles all the alerts which are sent by Prometheus server.
Alert manager is one of the very useful component of Prometheus tool.
If in case any big error or any issue occurs, alert manager manage those alerts and contact with human via E-mail, Text Messages, On-call, or any other chat application service.
5. User Interface
User interface is also a important component as it builds a bridge between the user and the system.
In Prometheus, user interface are note that much user friendly and can be used till graph queries.
For good exclusive dashboards Prometheus works together with Grafana (visualization tool).
Using Grafana over Prometheus to visualize properly we can use custom dashboards.
Grafana dashboards displays via pie charts, line charts, tables, good data graphs of CPU usage, RAM utilization, network load, etc with indicators.
Grafana supports and run with Prometheus by querying language i.e. PromQL.
To fetch data from Prometheus and to display the results on Grafana dashboards PromQL is used.
Prerequisite
Ubuntu with 20.04 Version
Root user account with sudo  privilege.
Prometheus system user and group.
Sufficient storage on your system and good internet connectivity.
